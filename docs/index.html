  <h1>XP POINTS TABLE</h1>
  <p class="accr">A huge thank you goes out to everyone in the WGT community who contributed in the collection of data contained in this table.<br><br>WGT, in their infinite wisdom, decided to remove a large chunk of the forum recently, for what I consider to be a ridiculous reason. But putting my thoughts aside, this table was one of the casualties of that action, so that is why I have resurrected it here.</p>
